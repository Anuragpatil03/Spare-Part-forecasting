# Spare-Part-forecasting
The Spare-Part Forecasting project aims to provide accurate predictions for spare part demand in order to optimize inventory management and ensure timely availability of spare parts.

# The Spare-Part Forecasting project offers the following features:

* Historical data analysis: Analyze historical demand data to identify patterns and trends.
* Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the spare part demand data to prepare it for modeling.
* Model training: Train machine learning models on the preprocessed data to forecast future demand.
* Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models to assess their accuracy and reliability.
* Demand prediction: Generate predictions for future spare part demand based on the trained models.
* Visualization: Visualize the historical and predicted demand data to gain insights and communicate results effectively.
